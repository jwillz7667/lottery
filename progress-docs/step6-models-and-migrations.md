# Step 6: Remaining Models and Database Systems

## Action Items Completed:

### 1. Implemented Remaining Models
- **Log Model**
  * Event logging system
  * Different log types (auth, payment, ai_interaction, error)
  * User-specific and system-wide logging
  
- **Wallet Model**
  * Secure wallet management
  * Encryption for private keys
  * Support for different wallet types (pot, service, user)
  
- **AIAgent Model**
  * Agent management system
  * Role-based agent tracking
  * Version control for models

### 2. Database Migration System
- Installed node-pg-migrate
- Created database.json configuration
- Implemented initial schema migration
- Added migration scripts to package.json:
  * migrate:up
  * migrate:down
  * migrate:create

### 3. Database Backup System
- Created backup utility (backup.ts)
  * Automated backup creation
  * Backup restoration
  * Old backup cleanup
  
- Implemented backup scheduler (backupScheduler.ts)
  * Daily automated backups
  * Error logging
  * Backup rotation (keeping last 7 backups)

## Features Added:
- Full TypeScript support
- Secure encryption for sensitive data
- Automated database maintenance
- Comprehensive logging system
- Version-controlled database schema

## Next Steps:
1. Implement data validation middleware
2. Create model unit tests
3. Set up continuous integration
4. Add monitoring system
5. Implement error handling middleware

## Technical Notes:
- Using AES-256-GCM for wallet encryption
- Daily backups scheduled at 2 AM
- Migrations support both up and down operations
- All operations are properly logged
