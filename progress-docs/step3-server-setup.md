# Step 3: Basic Server Setup

## Action Items Completed:
1. Created .env file with necessary configuration
2. Implemented basic Express server setup in app.ts:
   - Added middleware (cors, body-parser)
   - Set up basic health check route
   - Added error handling middleware
3. Created server entry point in index.ts:
   - Server initialization
   - Port configuration
   - Environment logging

## Server Structure:
- Basic Express application with middleware
- Health check endpoint at /health
- Error handling middleware
- Environment-based configuration

## Next Steps:
1. Implement database connection (PostgreSQL)
2. Create database models
3. Implement authentication middleware
4. Set up route handlers for:
   - Authentication
   - Payment verification
   - AI interaction
   - Lottery management

## Notes:
- Server configured to run on PORT 3000 by default
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
