# Step 7: Validation, Testing, and Monitoring Implementation

## Action Items Completed:

### 1. Data Validation System
- Implemented Joi validation schemas for:
  * User data
  * Transaction data
  * Prompt data
  * Wallet data
  * AI Agent data
- Created validation middleware
- Added error handling for validation failures
- Integrated with logging system

### 2. Error Handling System
- Created custom error classes
- Implemented global error handler
- Added specific handlers for:
  * Database errors
  * JWT errors
  * Validation errors
- Integrated with logging system

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- Set up Jest with TypeScript
- Created test environment configuration
- Implemented test database setup
- Added test utilities
- Created example unit tests for User model
- Set up test coverage reporting

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- Configured GitHub Actions workflow
- Set up automated testing
- Added PostgreSQL service container
- Configured test environment
- Added coverage reporting
- Prepared deployment pipeline

### 5. Monitoring System
- Implemented Prometheus metrics:
  * HTTP request metrics
  * Database operation metrics
  * Active connections tracking
  * Lottery pot size monitoring
- Added Winston logging:
  * Request/response logging
  * Error logging
  * Performance monitoring
- Created monitoring middleware

## Technical Details:
- Using Joi for schema validation
- Jest and ts-jest for testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Prometheus for metrics
- Winston for logging

## Next Steps:
1. Add more comprehensive unit tests
2. Set up integration tests
3. Configure production deployment
4. Add performance monitoring dashboards
5. Implement alerting system

## Notes:
- All validation follows strict TypeScript typing
- Tests run in isolated database
- Monitoring covers both application and database metrics
- Error handling provides detailed logging
- CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality
