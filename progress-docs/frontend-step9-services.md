# Frontend Implementation - Step 9: Services

## Action Items Completed:

### 1. WebSocket Service
- Implemented WebSocket service:
  * Real-time updates
  * Automatic reconnection
  * Event handlers
  * Type safety
  * Error handling
  * Connection management

### 2. API Testing Suite
- Created comprehensive tests:
  * Authentication tests
  * Transaction tests
  * Prompt tests
  * Lottery tests
  * Error handling tests
  * Mock server setup
  * Test utilities

### 3. Monitoring Service
- Implemented API monitoring:
  * Health checks
  * Performance metrics
  * Error tracking
  * Service status
  * Latency monitoring
  * Notification system

### 4. Caching Service
- Created caching system:
  * TTL-based caching
  * Cache invalidation
  * Pattern-based invalidation
  * Capacity management
  * Type safety
  * Separate cache instances

### 5. Integration Points
