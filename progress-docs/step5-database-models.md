# Step 5: Database Models Implementation

## Action Items Completed:
1. Created TypeScript interfaces for all database models in `interfaces.ts`:
   - IUser
   - ITransaction
   - IPrompt
   - ILottery
   - ILog
   - IWallet
   - IAIAgent

2. Created SQL initialization script (`init.sql`):
   - All tables defined with proper constraints
   - Indexes for performance optimization
   - Default entries for wallet addresses

3. Created database initialization utility (`dbInit.ts`):
   - Reads and executes SQL script
   - Handles transactions
   - Error handling and rollback support

4. Implemented core model classes:
   - User.ts
     * User creation with password hashing
     * Email/ID lookup
     * Credit management
     * Password verification
   
   - Transaction.ts
     * Transaction creation and lookup
     * Status updates
     * Pot value calculation
   
   - Prompt.ts
     * Prompt creation and response handling
     * User prompt history
     * Winning prompt tracking
   
   - Lottery.ts
     * Pot management
     * Winner recording
     * History tracking

## Database Features:
- Full TypeScript support with interfaces
- Proper error handling
- Transaction support for complex operations
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Indexed queries for performance
- Automatic timestamps

## Next Steps:
1. Implement remaining models (Log, Wallet, AIAgent)
2. Create database migration system
3. Add data validation middleware
4. Implement model unit tests
5. Add database backup system

## Notes:
- All models follow TypeScript best practices
- Database operations are properly typed
- Transactions used for data integrity
- Indexes added for query optimization
